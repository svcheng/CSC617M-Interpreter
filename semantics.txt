Other syntax rules (besides grammar rules)
- records should not be defined recursively (done)
- functions (all done)
    - functions should be passed the correct number of parameters (done)
    - return statements should only be in function bodies (done)
    - void functions should not return values and non-void functions should return values (done)
- declarations (all done)
    - variables/arguments should only be assigned types that have been defined (done)
    - identifiers should not be reused (except var decs where the previous declarations were in lower-level scopes) (done)
    - identifiers should not be used before declared (done)
    - identifiers should not be keywords (done)

Semantics
- constants cannot be re-assigned (done)
- constants cannot be records and arrays (these are mutable)
- everything is pass by value except records and arrays
- type checking
    - check that types are correct: operands, function parameters (including print and scan), assignment rvalues, for loop parameters, conditions, etc.
    - type casting in arithmetic ops between numbers (int to float)
    - type inference for constant/variable declaration (e.g. var x = 5+1; <- compiler should know x is integer)
    - array indices and sizes must be non-negative integers
- scoping rules when variables are referenced
