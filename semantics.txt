Syntax rules (besides grammar rules) (all done)
- records should not be defined recursively
- functions
    - functions should be passed the correct number of parameters
    - return statements should only be in function bodies
    - void functions should not return values and non-void functions should return values
- declarations
    - identifiers should not be keywords
    - declared types of variables/arguments should be defined
    - identifiers should not be reused (within a scope)
    - identifiers should not be referenced before they are declared

Compile-time Semantics (all done)
- constants cannot be re-assigned
- constants cannot be records and arrays (these are mutable)
- scoping rule
    - only existing types and functions can be referenced
    - variables cannot be referenced before they are declared
    - to determine type of variable when its name is bound to more than 1 variable, choose the one in the innermost scope
    - conditional and loop blocks have an inner scope
- type checking
    - check that types are correct: operands, function parameters (including print and scan), assignment rvalues, for loop parameters, conditions, etc.
    - type casting in arithmetic ops between numbers (int to float)
    - type inference for constant/variable declaration (e.g. var x = 5+1; <- compiler should know x is integer)
    - array indices and sizes must be integers

Run-time Semantics
- to determine value of variable when its name is bound to more than 1 variable, choose the one in the innermost scope
- everything is pass by value except records and arrays
- array access bounds checking
- default values (instead of NULL, like in C)
- auto type casting in arithmetic ops
- type checking for array variable assignment (assigning variable of type array to another variable of type array) and returning arrays (exact size of array can only be known at runtime)
