Other syntax rules (besides grammar rules)
- records should not be defined recursively (done)
- functions
    - functions should be passed the correct number of parameters (done)
    - return statements should only be in function bodies (done)
    - void functions should not return values and non-void functions should return values (done)
- variables/arguments should only be assigned types that have been defined (done)
- identifiers should not be used before declared (done but without scoping)

Semantics
- constants cannot be re-assigned
- scoping rules
- type checking
    - check that types are correct: operands, function parameters (including print and scan), assignment rvalues, for loop parameters, conditions, etc.
    - type casting in arithmetic ops between numbers (int to float)
    - type inference for constant/variable declaration (e.g. var x = 5+1; <- compiler should know x is integer)
    - array indices and sizes must be non-negative integers
